### Code of Conduct
I expect the community this game fosters to be civil and mature. I am no manner of "fun police." Still, things like racism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other -phobia are not going to be tolerated. They will result in a warning, and if the behavior continues, a permanent ban from participating in any official spaces.

### Standards
Absolutely all interaction in public _or_ private community spaces are subject to this code of conduct.

#### Hostility
Please do try to remove unnecessary hostility from your messages. There is absolutely no need for the incredibly hostile environment that the modern internet seems to have become. If someone is being hostile to you, just report them to a moderator on whatever platform and move on with your life. You do not have to win arguments with people you've never met--you're just wasting time better spent programming.

#### Topicality
Try to stay on topic. The occasional tangent doesn't matter much, but whole ass conversations should be kept to private things like DM/PMs. This is a community for Stormsinger, not for random discussions. We are not a debate team.

---

### Enforcement
Community leaders, be it moderators in wikis or other spaces, are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior, and must take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate. They have full power to do anything they see fit to enforce said rules. Should they abuse this privilege, they will be removed and replaced swiftly. I do not care for bullshit.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at their listed business email, or directly at Israfil's email [here](israfiel_buisness.nearly025@passfwd.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Punishments will be decided at the disgression of the involved moderator(s). Should a punishment be deemed unfair, the moderator will be warned, and if repeat offending, removed from their position.
